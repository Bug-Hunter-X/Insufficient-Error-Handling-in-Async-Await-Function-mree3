This example demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await programming model: insufficient error handling. The `fetchData` function uses async/await to fetch data from a network API. However, the error handling in the `Task` block is minimal, only printing an error message to the console. This is insufficient for production-ready code, as it may lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the error is not handled correctly.  The solution demonstrates more robust error handling, including specific error type checking and a retry mechanism.
